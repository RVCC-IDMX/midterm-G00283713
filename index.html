            <p>This is my first blade project attempted. I have no sanders or power hammers. Everything was done by hand. The blade is made from unknown carbon steel I had laying around my fathers garage. 
                The dimensions fit this into being a Wakizashi or short Sword. There was much work done in between these 3 images. The hamon is like a Gunome/Choji with many Tobiyaki. The goal is to produce a Hamon in Nie Deki. Blade is yet to be quenched. Still in phase of image 3.</p>

                <p>Well done for your first blade! Mine looked terrible when I first started years ago. Would have been much better if this blade was forged out, but considering its your fisrt one its a great start. Never myself have done clayed hardening. Good luck!</p>
